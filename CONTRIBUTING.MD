# Contributing

Welcome! The Goldfinch community is on a mission to improve access to capital and increase financial inclusion. We're so glad to have your help! This guide gives an overview of how you can contribute to the code, and tips for doing so.

Please note we have a code of conduct below, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Lifecycle of Contributing
1. Create an issue (on Github Issues) or pick up an issue already raised by someone else. Issues can be bugs, new features / ideas, or chores.
2. Propose a rough idea of how you plan to solve it, so you don't waste time doing something that won't be accepted.
3. Write your code!
4. Raise a PR
5. Get comments / feedback, and re-submit
6. Repeat step 5 until it's approved.
7. Merge!

## Tips for writing a great PR
* Follow existing style conventions
* Write tests for your change!
* Give useful context on *why* you made particular dev decisions, especially if they might be seen as unusual or unexpected.
