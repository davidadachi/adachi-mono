## Reporting a Vulnerability

The community has an on-going [$500k Bug Bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/goldfinch/) through Immunefi. Please see their site for full details on the program, and what's in scope. All security vulnerabilities, even urgent ones, should be reported through Immunefi: https://immunefi.com/bounty/goldfinch/. 

You can also reach out through the security[at]goldfinch.finance mailing list, but if you want to be recognized for the disclosure, you must submit through Immunefi.
