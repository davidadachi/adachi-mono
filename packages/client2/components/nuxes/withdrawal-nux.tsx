          ðŸŽ‰ Announcing Senior Pool Withdrawal Requests
        </div>
        <div className="mb-5 text-center ">
          As outlined in GIP-25, LPs must now submit a{" "}
          <strong>Withdrawal Request</strong> to withdraw FIDU from the Senior
          Pool. Here&apos;s how it works:
        </div>
        <ul className="mb-10 list-outside list-disc pl-4 text-xs">
          <li className="mb-3">
            A single Withdrawal Request may be fulfilled over multiple
            distribution periods. Distributions happen every 2 weeks, and
            distribution amounts are variable based on availability of capital
            in the Senior Pool and total amount requested.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-3">
            A Withdrawal Request remains active until it is completely fulfilled
            or cancelled. An LP can only have one active Request at a time.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-3">
            FIDU that is staked or supplied to a Membership Vault must be
            unstaked or removed from the Vault before an LP can submit a request
            to withdraw it from the Senior Pool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once a Withdrawal Request has been made, it can only be increased or
            cancelled, not reduced. If a Request is cancelled before it is fully
            fulfilled, the LP is charged a cancellation fee.
          </li>
        </ul>
