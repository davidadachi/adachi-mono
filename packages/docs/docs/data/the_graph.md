# The Graph

Goldfinch maintains a subgraph on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/goldfinch-eng/goldfinch) that indexes useful state about the Goldfinch Protocol. This subgraph is used by the Goldfinch Interface and may be used by anyone.

The subgraph can be accessed programmatically at https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/goldfinch-eng/goldfinch. The GraphQL schema of the subgraph is located in the [open-source repo](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/main/packages/subgraph/schema.graphql).
