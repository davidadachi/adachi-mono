# What is Goldfinch?

"Goldfinch" encompasses a few different things, which we should distinguish:
- The Goldfinch Protocol
  - A set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, which together comprise a decentralized credit protocol for financing off-chain economic activity.
- The Goldfinch Interface
  - The web app served at https://app.goldfinch.finance, providing a convenient way (but not the only way) to use the Goldfinch Protocol.
- Goldfinch Governance
  - A governance system for governing the Goldfinch Protocol, built around the GFI token and the discussion forum served at https://gov.goldfinch.finance.
- Warbler Labs
  - The company which initially developed the Goldfinch Protocol and the Goldfinch Interface.
