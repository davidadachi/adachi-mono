# Oracles

The Goldfinch Protocol does not use oracles -- that is, on-chain "sources of truth" about off-chain data -- operated by third parties. The Goldfinch Protocol does use an oracle which it operates, insofar as UID is an oracle by virtue of representing the off-chain identity to which a chain address corresponds.

The Goldfinch Protocol does make use of on-chain data sources that are external to the Protocol but which are not oracles. For example, the Protocol integrates with the Curve pool for FIDU/USDC.
