## Borrower

These contracts represent the a convenient way for a borrower to interact with Goldfinch
 They are 100% optional. However, they let us add many sophisticated and convient features for borrowers
 while still keeping our core protocol small and secure. We therefore expect most borrowers will use them.
 This contract is the &quot;official&quot; borrower contract that will be maintained by Goldfinch governance. However,
 in theory, anyone can fork or create their own version, or not use any contract at all. The core functionality
 is completely agnostic to whether it is interacting with a contract or an externally owned account (EOA).

### drawdown

```solidity

```

Allows a borrower to drawdown on their creditline through the CreditDesk.

| poolAddress | address | The creditline from which they would like to drawdown |
