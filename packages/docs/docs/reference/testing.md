# Testing

The Goldfinch Protocol and the Goldfinch Interface are thoroughly tested.

The test suites can be viewed in the open-source repo:
- [Goldfinch Protocol](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/tree/main/packages/protocol/test)
- [Goldfinch Interface](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/tree/main/packages/client/src/__tests__)

The test suites do not currently produce a code coverage report.

The Protocol's smart contracts have not undergone formal verification.

The Protocol's smart contracts are developed against extensive use of Ethereum mainnet, via so-called "mainnet forking". Deployment to Ethereum testnets is also used in development.
