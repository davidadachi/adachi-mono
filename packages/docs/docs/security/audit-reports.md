# Audit reports

Security is of absolute, paramount importance in the development of the Goldfinch Protocol. To that end, Goldfinch engages external auditors to review all smart contract code. Warbler Labs also maintains its own internal audit process for all smart contract code.

Since inception, Goldfinch has published the report from every external audit in an [open-source repo](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/goldfinch-contracts).

For convenience, here are the links to those reports, labeled by their corresponding release milestone.
