# Summary

* _tokenByIndex_ off-by-one error
  * **Severity**:  üü° Medium
  * **Description**: The first valid position id is 1. The token at position 0 should be 1 and the token at position i should be i + 1.
  * **Suggested Fix**: We should return `index + 1` instead of `index`
  * **Commit**: [5495ee0](https://github.com/warbler-labs/mono/pull/1069/commits/5495ee01daa5e24b86a32a3be2dea71c5b83db61)

* Methods to fetch a position should revert if a position doesn't exist
  * **Severity**: üü¢ Informational
  * **Description**: It would make sense for the method to revert entirely
    if a position doesn't exist. That way the caller doesn't need to validate
    that a position actually exists.
  * **Suggested Fix**: Add an internal helper method like this
    ```solidity
    function _getPosition(uint positionId) internal returns (Position storage) {
      Position storage p = positions[positionId];

      bool positionExists = /* do some validation here */;
      if (!positionExists  {
        revert PositionDoesNotExist();
      }

      return p;
    }
    ```
    and use it throughout the contract
  * **Commit**: [5495ee0](https://github.com/warbler-labs/mono/pull/1069/commits/5495ee01daa5e24b86a32a3be2dea71c5b83db61)

## External Functions

### `constructor`

No initialization needed.

### `depositERC721`
- [x] onlyOperator
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Does not take into account capital appreciation or depreciation. This means
  that regardless of how much the value of a vaulted asset changes, the benefit to
  membership score will remain constant until the asset is withdraw and
  re-deposited.

## Issues
* üöë For a number of methods that fetch a position, it would make sense for the
* method to revert entirely if a position doesn't exist. That way the caller
  doesn't need to validate that a position actually exists. To make this easier
  I would suggest adding an internal helper method like this
  ```solidity
  function _getPosition(uint positionId) internal returns (Position storage) {
    Position storage p = positions[positionId];

    bool positionExists = /* do some validation here */;
    if (!positionExists  {
      revert PositionDoesNotExist();
    }

    return p;
  }
  ```

  and use it throughout the contract
