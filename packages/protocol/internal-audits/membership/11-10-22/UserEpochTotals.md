# UserEpochTotals Audit
Auditor: [Dalton](https://github.com/daltyboy11)

UserEpochTotals.sol audit.

# Summary
We have a couple of nits but they're by no means launch blockers.

* _getTotals_ argument could be `memory` instead of `storage`.
  * **Severity**: 🟢 Informational
  * **Description**: _getTotals_ doesn't modify any `storage` so the storage param could be a `memory` param.
  This might be worse OR better but it depends on if we call in to the lib using a storage or memory struct.
  If we mostly use storage structs then there's gas overhead in copying the struct to memory when invoking the lib
  * **Suggested Fix**: No action necessary
  * **Commit**: [5495ee0](https://github.com/warbler-labs/mono/pull/1069/commits/5495ee01daa5e24b86a32a3be2dea71c5b83db61)

* _recordDecrease_ is not defensive about checking for valid input
  * **Severity**: 🟢 Informational
  * **Description**: There are several assumptions _recordDecrease_ makes about its input without explicitly checking
    * `total.checkpointedAt <= Epochs.current()`
    * `Epochs.fromSeconds(depositTimestamp) <= Epochs.current()`
    * `Epochs.fromSeconds(depositTimestamp) <= total.checkpointedAt`
    * `amount <= total.totalAmount`
  * **Suggested Fix**: No action necessary. I only wanted to call it out.
  * **Commit**: [5495ee0](https://github.com/warbler-labs/mono/pull/1069/commits/5495ee01daa5e24b86a32a3be2dea71c5b83db61)

# Appendix
Auditor's notes. Not intended to be understood by readers but kept for reference/completeness

## Legend
* ✅ Looks good
  * reasonably confident in the security
* ❓ Questionable
  * An non-security issue, an issue where it's unclear if it's security related, or a security
    related issue that isn't a launch blocker.
* 🛑 Security vulnerability
  * A security bug that must be fixed before launch

## Function-by-function analysis

- ✅ _recordIncrease(total, amount)_
  - How could it break?
    - ✅ Forgets to checkpoint first
      - It checkpoints
    - ✅ Changes total `totalAmount` by wrong amount
      - It increases `totalAmount` by exactly `amount`
    - ✅ Changes `eligibleAmount` - it should never do this because none of the deposit is eligible during
      the epoch in which the deposit occurs
      - It doesn't

- ✅ _recordDecrease(total, amount, depositTimestamp)_
  - General comments
    - If we invert the if condition then we can pull `totalAmount -= amount` out
      ```
      total.totalAmount -= amount
      if (Epochs.current() > Epochs.fromSeconds(depositTimestamp)) {
        total.eligibleAmount -= amount
      }
      ```
  - How could it break?
    - ✅ Forgets to checkpoint first
      - It checkpoints
    - Changes `totalAmount` by wrong amount
      - ✅ It should decrease `totalAmount` by `amount` unconditionally
        - ✅ It decreases `totalAmount` by `amount` if the deposited epoch is in the past, which is correct
        - ✅ It decreases `totalAmount` by `amount` if the deposited epoch is current, which is correct
      - ✅ It should decrease eligible amount if deposit epoch is in the past
        - It does
      - ✅ It should leave eligible amount unchanged if deposit epoch is in the past
    - ❓ Invalid Inputs
      - ❓ The function's behavior relies on trusted input that doesn't fall into the following situations
        - `total.checkpointedAt <= Epochs.current()`
        - `Epochs.fromSeconds(depositTimestamp) <= Epochs.current()`
        - `Epochs.fromSeconds(depositTimestamp) <= total.checkpointedAt`
        - `amount <= total.totalAmount`

- ❓ _getTotals(_total)_
  - ❓ Can be made `memory` instead of `storage`. Would avoid having to explicitly copy it into memory in
    the function body

- ✅ _\_checkpoint(total)_
  - ✅ How could it break?
    - ✅ Doesn't checkpoint when `checkpointedAt` is stale
      - It checkpoints
    - ✅ Doesn't update `checkpointedAt` when it's stale
      - It does update
    - ✅ Doesn't make totalAmount eligible  when `checkpointedAt` is stale
      - It does
    - 🛑 Invalid input where `checkpointedAt > Epochs.current()`
      - We should change the check to
        ```
        if (total.checkpointedAt >= Epochs.current()) return;
        ```
        Because if the caller could manipulate the input to have `checkpointedAt` > Epochs.current()
        then the eligibleAmount would be to totalAmount too early.

## Dependency Analysis 
Quick checks to see if the callers of the fn's are using the fn's in a way that makes sense.
Ways that don't make sense could be misinterpreting the return values or passing incorrect vals
as parameters.

- ✅  _recordIncrease(total, amount)_ is called by...
  - ✅  _CapitalLedger_
    - ✅  _depositERC721(owner, assetAddress, id)_
      - ✅  Records an increase in `owner`'s total of `usdcEquivalent`. Checks out
  - ✅  _GFILedger_
    - ✅  _deposit(owner, amount)_
      - ✅  Already audited. Looks good

- ✅ _recordDecrease(total, amount, depositTimestamp)_ is called by...
  - ✅ _CapitalLedger_
    - ✅ _withdraw(id)_
      - ✅ Records decrease by `usdcEquivalent` of the asset type being withdrawn. Checks out
  - ✅ _GFILedger_
    - ✅ _withdraw(id, amount)_
      - ✅ Records decrease by `amount`. Checks out.
    - ✅ _\_withdraw(id)_
      - ✅ Records decrease by full position amount. Checks out.

- ✅ _getTotals(\_total)_ is called by...
  - ✅ _CapitalLedger_
    - ✅ _totalsOf(addr)_
      - ✅ Return type is `(eligibleAmount, totalAmount)` and it returns `totals[addr].getTotals()`, whose return type
        is `(current, next)`. `current` maps to `eligible` and `next` maps to `total` so this checks out.
    - ✅ _GFILedger_
      - ✅ _totalsOf(addr)_
        - ✅ Same as _CapitalLedger_

- ✅  _\_checkpoint(total)_ is called by...
  - ✅  Checkpoint is an internal function so it's callers have already been analyzed in the isolated analysis

### Pre-audit Checlist
#### Legend
* ✅ Looks good
* 🚧 No action needed but good to be aware of
* 🛑 Action needed
* ⚪ Not applicable


* ✅ Testing and compilation
  * ✅ Changes have solid branch and line coverage
    * Couldn't generate coverage report for this because forge doesn't support coverage for libs atm:
    https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2567 but all fns are covered indirectly in the GFILedger
    and CapitalLedger tests
  * ⚪ Tests for event emissions
    * No event emissions in lib
  * ⚪ Mainnet forking tests
  * ✅ Contract compiles without warnings
  * ⚪ Any public fns that could be external are external

* ✅ Documentation
  * ✅ Fns are documented with NatSpec
  * ⚪ If the behavior of existing `external` and `public` functions was changed then their NatSpec was updated

* ⚪ Access Control
  * N/A for libs

* ⚪ For the auditors
  * N/A for libs

* ⚪ Proxies
  * N/A for libs

* ✅ Safe Operations

## `UserEpochTotal`

a struct that wraps logic for checkpoint how much a user has of something in
that's elligible in a given epoch. When a user first deposits the amount will be
count towards the total amount, but not the "elligible" amount. When an epoch is
crossed over the total amount becomes the ellible amount.


### `recordIncrease`
- [x] checkpoints
* Increases the amount and checkpoints if we crossed an epoch

### `recordDecrease`
- [x] checkpoints
Looks good

### `getTotals`
- [x] checkpoints
* Returns the totals
