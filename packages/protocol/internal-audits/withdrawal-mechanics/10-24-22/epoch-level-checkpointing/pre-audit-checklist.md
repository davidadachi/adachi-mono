# Pre-audit Checklist
Auditor: [Dalton](https://github.com/daltyboy11)

In this section we go through the [audit checklist](internal-audits/withdrawal-mechanics/withdrawal-mechanics-audit.md)

## Legend
ðŸš§ = WIP
âœ… = Done
ðŸš« = Not applicable

## List

* âœ… Testing and compilation
  * âœ… Changes have 100% line and branch coverage
    * Generated coverage data using `forge coverage --match-contract SeniorPoolTest --report lcov`. Then I generated the html report
      using `genhtml lcov.info`. Initial line coverage was 93.2%. We were missing tests for initialization and epoch initialization. After
      adding them in line coverage is at 99.6% and I'm satisfied with that.
  * âœ…  I have written mainnet forking tests for my changes
  * âœ…  The contracts compile without errors or warnings
    * There are _some_ compilation warnings but they're all in testing files. This is acceptable.
  * âœ…  Public fns restricted to `external` where possible
* âœ…  Documentation
  * âœ… All new `external` and `public` fns are documented with NatSpec
  * âœ… If the behavior of existing `external` or `public` fns was changed then their NatSpec was updated
* âœ… Access control
  * âœ… I have double checked the permissions on `external` and `public` fns
    * âœ… `ISeniorPoolEpochWithdrawals`
      * âœ…_setEpochDuration: onlyAdmin
      * âœ… _initializeEpochs: onlyAdmin
        * There's no reason why it needs onlyAdmin because the require statement will make it revert after the firt call. There's also no harm in keeping it.
      * âœ… requestWithdrawal: callable by KYC'd addresses, cannot be called by address with existing token
      * âœ… addToWithdrawalRequest(): callable by KYC'd address who owns the token
      * âœ… cancelWithdrawalRequest(): callable by KYC'd address who owns the token
      * âœ… claimWithdrawalRequest(): callable by KYC'd address who owns the token
    * âœ… `WithdrawalRequestToken`
      * âœ… initialize: onlyInitializer
      * âœ… mint(), burn(): onlySeniorPool, 
      * âœ… approve(), setApprovalForAll(), transferFrom(), safeTransferFrom(): revert unconditionally
* âœ… For the auditors
 * âœ… critical areas for the auditors to focus on are called out
* ðŸš« Library Dependencies
* âœ… Proxies
  * âœ… Changes to upgradeable contracts do not cause storage collisions
* âœ… Safe Operations
  * âœ… Using SafeERC20TRansfer
  * âœ… Using SafeMath for arithmetic
    * There are a couple places where we don't use SafeMath because we don't think it's necessary. We don't use SafeMath for incrementing `_checkpointedEpochId`
    because it starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 at the end of each epoch duration. We don't use SafeMath for incrementing a request's `epochCursor` for the
    same reason
  * âœ… Using SafeCast for casting
    * Added SafeCast for converting the writedown amount from `int256` to `uint256`
  * âœ… No iterating on unbounded arrays or pasing them around as params
    * We can consider the for loops in _previewWithdrawRequestCheckpoint and
      _applyWithdrawalRequestCheckpoint to be semi unbounded. They're theoretically
      unbounded but Goldfinch will be long out of business before they reach a number
      of iterations that cannot be executed in a single block.
  * âœ… Arithmetic performs division steps at the end to minimize rounding errors
  * âœ… Not using the built-in transfer fn
  * ðŸš« All user-inputted addresses are verified before instantiating them in a contract (e.g. `CreditLine(userSuppliedAddress)`)
    * The changes to not instantiate any contracts from user supplied addresses
  * ðŸš« State updates are done BEFORE calls to untrusted addresses
    * The senior pool does not call any untrusted contracts
  * âœ… Inputs to `external` and `public` fns are validated
    * âœ… setEpochDuration
      * âœ… Check epochDuration > 0
    * âœ… requestWithdrawal
      * âœ… Check request amount doesn't exceed caller's fidu balance
        * We don't check explicitly, but if the user doesn't have sufficient balance
          then the safeTransferFrom call will revert
    * âœ… addToWithdrawalRequest
      * âœ… Check that request amount doesn't exceed caller's fidu balance
        * Like requestWithdrawal, we don't check explicitly
      * âœ… Check that caller owns tokenId
    * âœ… cancelWithdrawalRequest
      * âœ… Check that caller owns tokenId
    * âœ… claimWithdrawalRequest
      * âœ… Check that caller owns tokenId
  * ðŸš« If your feature relies on SECONDS_PER_YEAR then it is not adversely affected by leap years
* âœ…  Speed bumps, circuit breakers, and monitoring
  * ðŸš« Are any speed bumps necessary? E.g. a delay between locking a TranchedPool and drawing down
  * ðŸš« If changes rely on a pricing oracle (e.g. Curve Pool) then a circuit breaker is build in to limit
    the effect of drastic price changes
  * âœ…  Events are emitted for all state changes
    * âœ…  Events are emitted for
      * âœ… requestWithdrawal (WithdrawalRequested)
      * âœ… addToWithdrawalRequest (WithdrawalAddedTo)
      * âœ… cancelWithdrawalRequest (WithdrawalCanceled)
      * âœ… claimWithdrawalRequest (Withdraw - reusing existing event)
      * âœ… setEpochDuration
* âœ… Third party integrations
  * âœ… I have assessed the impact of changes (breaking or non-breaking) to existing
    functions on 3rd party protocols that have integrated with Goldfinch.
    * Taken care of by posting in the discord to warn community about the breaking changes
